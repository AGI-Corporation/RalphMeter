# RalphMeter Progress Log

## Project Initialized
Date: 2026-01-30
Description: RalphMeter - A metering, transparency, and benchmarking layer for AI coding agents.

The goal: Define the physical unit for AI code synthesis energy.
- Input: PRD (intent)
- Output: Verified Application (LOC that passes all gates)
- Measure: Verified LOC per Joule/Token/Dollar

Core concepts:
- 4-Gate Model: Compile → Run → Integrate → Verify
- PoE-LOC-M: Probability of Error per Line of Code per Minute
- Verified LOC: Code that passes all 4 gates
- Efficiency: Verified LOC / Energy spent
