# RalphMeter Progress Log

## Project Initialized
Date: 2026-01-30
Description: RalphMeter - A metering, transparency, and benchmarking layer for AI coding agents.

The goal: Define the physical unit for AI code synthesis energy.
- Input: PRD (intent)
- Output: Verified Application (LOC that passes all gates)
- Measure: Tokens per Synth (cost of synthesis)

Core concepts:
- **Synth**: Tokens spent per Verified LOC within a Ralph story (lower is better)
- Stories are the verification boundary — passes: true/false
- When a story passes, Synth = Total Tokens / Verified LOC for that story
- 4-Gate Model: Compile → Run → Reachable (AI-explored) → Correct (tests pass)
- PoE-LOC: Probability of Error per Line of Code
- Example: Story US-003 passes with 85 vLOC using 4,250 tokens = 50 Synths

Key insight: A line can only be verified as part of the whole app, but G3 (reachability) 
can be measured per-line via AI exploration with coverage instrumentation.
